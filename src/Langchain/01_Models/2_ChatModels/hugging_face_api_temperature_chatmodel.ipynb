      "Okay, the user wants a 5-line poem about cricket. Let me start by thinking about the key elements of cricket that are unique and vivid. The game is all about teamwork, strategy, and the excitement of the match. I should include some imagery like the ball, the bat, the field, and maybe the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: Maybe start with the action of the ball being hit. \"A ball of fury, spun and spun...\" That gives a sense of the ball's movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second line: Introduce the players. \"Through the field, batsmen run...\" Shows the movement of the players chasing the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third line: Highlight the skill and precision. \"Each stroke a dance, a master's art...\" Emphasizes the skill involved in playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth line: The crowd's reaction. \"The crowd's roar, a symphony of cheers...\" Creates a lively atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth line: Conclude with the essence of the game. \"One match, a world, one heartbeat, one score...\" Suggests the unity and the momentary high of scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, does that flow well? Let me check the rhythm. Each line is roughly the same length, which is good for a poem. The imagery connects well between the ball, the players, the crowd, and the score. It captures the dynamic nature of cricket. Maybe I can tweak the first line to make it more vivid. \"A ball of fury, spun and spun...\" Maybe \"A ball of fury, spun and spun...\" Hmm, \"fury\" might be too strong. Perhaps \"A ball of fire, spun and spun...\" That's better. Let me adjust the first line to \"A ball of fire, spun and spun...\" and see how it fits. The rest of the lines should still make sense. Yeah, that works. The poem now has a good flow and conveys the excitement and skill of cricket in five lines.\n",
